synopsis: Re-instate `initialBuildSteps`
packages: Cabal
issues: #9856
prs: #9950

description: {

The `initialBuildSteps` function from `Distribution.Simple.Build`, which had
been hastily removed, has been reinstated.

It now comes with a deprecation warning: calling that function does not suffice
to prepare the sources for a package, as there are other steps that one might
also need to perform:

  - running pre-processors (such as alex/happy)
  - running pre-build hooks or custom logic
    (in build-type: Hooks or build-type: Custom or Configure)

Consumers wanting to prepare the sources of a package, e.g. in order to launch a
REPL session, are advised to run `setup repl --repl-multi-file=<fn>` instead.

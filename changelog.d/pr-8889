synopsis: Replace cabal project parsing with Parsec
packages: cabal-install Cabal Cabal-syntax
prs: #8889
issues: #6101 #7748

description: {

Replaced the legacy cabal.project parser with a new implementation based on Parsec.
The new parser replicates the grammar of the legacy parser, ensuring that it generates identical ProjectConfig values for the same input.
The implementation leverages existing Parsec infrastructure, including FieldGrammar and other utilities from the .cabal file parser.
Legacy parsing functions are still accessible but will be removed in the future.
